Throughout history, God has sent to humanity a series of divine Educators—known 
as Manifestations of God—whose teachings have provided the basis for the advancement of civilization.
These Manifestations have included Abraham, Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, and Muḥammad. 
Bahá’u’lláh, the latest of these Messengers, explained that the religions of the world 
come from the same Source and are in essence successive chapters of one religion from God.
Bahá’ís believe the crucial need facing humanity is to find a unifying vision of the future 
of society and of the nature and purpose of life. Such a vision unfolds in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh.
